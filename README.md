# Transliteration of Cyrillic

This is a simple transliteration of Cyrillic to Latin. I use [Wikipedia's transliteration table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_transliteration_of_Cyrillic). Moreover, you can use this repo as a library in Go.

NOTE: Caps are not supported.

## Usage

```bash
$ ./lat "Привет, мир!"
Privet, mir!
```

Add to path if you want to use it from anywhere.
